## ðŸ§¾ About

This project was created as part of the technical assessment for the **Mobile App Developer** role at **Pandar Resources**.  
The goal: build a minimal, clean, functional app that allows users to manage a list of items (e.g. tasks, products).  

- Uses local storage or a data source for persistence  
- Emphasis on code structure, readability, and user-friendly UX  
- Accompanied by documentation explaining setup, architecture, and ideas  

---

## âœ… Features

- View a list of items  
- Add a new item  
- Mark item as completed  
- Delete an item  
- Basic error-handling & input validation  
- Clean, responsive UI

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (>= 2.0)  
- Dart  
- An emulator or physical device (iOS or Android)  
- Git (to clone this repo)  

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ekojode/pandar.git
   cd pandar
   flutter pub get
   flutter run

## ðŸ§  Technical Decisions & Thought Process

- **Why Flutter?**  
  I chose Flutter for its cross-platform capabilities, expressive UI, and rapid iteration cycle.

- **State Management / Architecture**  
  Kept it simple (e.g. `StatefulWidget` / `setState`) given the small scope. Separation of concerns: UI layer vs data/service layer.

- **Data Storage / Persistence**  
  For this project, I used a local storage/data source (e.g. JSON, local DB) to simulate persistence. This could be swapped out for a remote API in future.

- **User Experience**  
  I prioritized minimalism and clarity: clear call-to-actions (Add, Delete), feedback on completion, and validation to prevent empty entries.

---

## ðŸ§— Challenges & Learnings

- Managing state updates cleanly when items are marked or removed  
- Ensuring UI updates reflect data changes immediately  
- Handling edge cases (e.g. empty input, duplicates)  
- Working under time constraints to keep code readable and modular  

Through this exercise, I reinforced principles of clean architecture, UI/UX thinking, and how to build a small but real-feel app from end to end.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- Sync with a remote API or backend  
- Offline-first mode & data sync  
- Use more advanced state management (Provider, BLoC, Riverpod)  
- Add animations & transitions  
- Add editing of existing items  
- Add user authentication & personalization
